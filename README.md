# Managing Multiple Environments

## Overview

Managing multiple environments in Terraform ensures that infrastructure changes are isolated, tested, and promoted in a controlled manner.

This approach helps maintain stability in production while enabling experimentation and development in separate environments.

## Structure

```
Terraform_AWS_tut/
├── infra                           # Environment definitions
│   ├── global/                     # Global resources (e.g., Route53 zone)
│   ├── production/                 # Production environment
│   └── bootstrap/                  # Staging/Testing environment
│
├── infra-modules/                  # Reusable Terraform modules
│
└── remote-backend/                 # Remote backend configuration (state management)
```

## Benefits of Multiple Environments

- **Isolation**: Changes in staging don’t affect production.
- **Testing**: Validate configurations before deploying live.
- **Reusability**: Share the same modules across environments.
- **Version Control**: Track environment-specific changes separately.
